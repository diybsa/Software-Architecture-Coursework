Depending on the situation, actions could include:

Talking it through as a group

Giving a reminder about group expectations

Asking the person to apologise if appropriate

Reassigning tasks if needed

Informing the lecturer or tutor only if the problem is serious or keeps happening

The focus should be on fixing the issue, keeping things fair, and making sure everyone feels comfortable working together.
